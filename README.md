This repository contains the code required to reproduce the figures, tables, and supplementary materials associated with the manuscript submitted by Pu et al. (2024). 

This code was developed using R (4.3.0, typical install time is less than 5 minutes).

The "data" folder contains the raw and clean data necessary for this analysis. These data are also deposited on Open Science Framework and can be accessed here: https://osf.io/2f47u/ (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/2F47U). 

The "code" folder contains (i) a data cleaning script and (ii) a data analysis and visualization script. To reproduce the figures, tables, and supplementary materials, run the "model.Rmd" file (typical run time is less than 5 minutes).
